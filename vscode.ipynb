    "# Introduction to VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is VS Code\n",
    "So far we've seen how simple text files with the `.py` extension can be executed through the Python interpreter. You can always write Python code in any text editor that you'd like as long as you save the file with the \".py\" extension. As the amount of code in our project grows larger and becomes gets more complex, however, it is helpful to have tools to aid us in managing our files, editing our code, debugging our code, and running tests to verify code functionality. This is what integrated development environments (IDEs) are designed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why are we using VS Code?\n",
    "There are numerous IDEs out there that can be used with Python including PyCharm, Spyder, Emacs, Vi/Vim, Atom, Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebooks, Sublime Text, and Notepad++; they each have their pros and cons. However, one of the most popular IDEs today is Visual Studio Code, often referred to as VS Code, which has become something of a de facto standard in many data science circles - and for good reason! \n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some of the reasons for the popularity of VS Code (along with the Python extension), including that it is...\n",
    "- Free (with an active development team expanding its functionality)\n",
    "- Cross-platform, meaning you can use it on Windows, macOS, or Linux\n",
    "- Extensible through a large marketplace for custom extensions that expand the base features of the IDE \n",
    "- Highly customizable in appearance and functionality based on your needs including settings like hotkeys to speed up your development\n",
    "- Debugging-friendly through an in-built debugger integration that works well with Python\n",
    "- Supportive of test suites and enables you to run a variety of tests\n",
    "- Easy to use with both Python files (`.py`) and Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`) and to quickly switch between files of those different formats\n",
    "- Designed to make version control with git simple and intuitive\n",
    "- Convenient for working with multiple Python environments to help you use the right version of Python and packages for each project that you're working on\n",
    "- Capable of linting, which analyzes your code for possible errors (much like when you're typing in Microsoft Word and a red squiggly line appears to tell you there is a spelling mistake)\n"

Each time you click one of these tools, the side bar will change to show the content corresponding to the tool.\n",
